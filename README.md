# Student Satisfaction Survey Analysis – University Library (UNNES)

# Overview
This project presents a structured quantitative evaluation of student satisfaction toward university library facilities using validated statistical methods. The analysis focuses on measuring service quality, facility effectiveness, and institutional performance based on survey data.

The objective is to assess how well the library supports academic activities through empirical measurement and statistical validation.

# Research Framework
The study applies a structured evaluation model integrating:

- EUCS (End User Computing Satisfaction) approach
- Pearson Product Moment Validity Testing
- Cronbach’s Alpha Reliability Testing
- Descriptive Statistical Analysis

# Dataset
- 145 validated respondents
- 34 Likert-scale measurement items
- 5 core evaluation dimensions

# Statistical Validation Results
- All 34 items are statistically valid (p < 0.10)
- Cronbach’s Alpha = 0.941 (Excellent internal consistency)
- Strong measurement reliability across all dimensions

# Evaluation Dimensions
1. Usage Intensity  
2. Academic Facility Utilization  
3. Facility Availability and Accessibility  
4. Learning Environment Satisfaction  
5. Service Governance and Accessibility  

# Key Findings
- Overall satisfaction level categorized as Very High
- Highest evaluation score: Service Governance and Accessibility (86.58%)
- Strong positive perception across all five dimensions
- High internal consistency indicates stable perception patterns

# Research Implications
The findings indicate that the university library has achieved strong service performance and institutional credibility from a user perspective.

Strategic implications include:
- Maintaining operational consistency in governance and accessibility
- Optimizing usage intensity (dimension with relatively lower score)
- Prioritizing continuous monitoring through periodic quantitative evaluation
- Strengthening data-driven decision making in facility development

This analysis supports evidence-based institutional improvement and performance monitoring.
